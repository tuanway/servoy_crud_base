CRUD based framework

This framework is intended to help Servoy developers quickly setup custom CRUD based applications.
It supports tablet/desktop sized screens and uses easily extended templates to help users create screens fast.
Before starting with this framework, it is expected that the developer has some basic training already on Servoy and understands the concept of inheritance and foundsets.
